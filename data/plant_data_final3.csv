Spineless Yucca,"
                                                        Yuccas are pretty well known easy house plants, tolerating full sun and thriving on a minimal amount of care. Large and or branched specimens are hard to get hold of but make a fantastic specimen plant for a well lit room or conservatory.

ZZ Plant,"
                                                        Only recently has this plant been seen in the UK (Its name is heard even less!). Zamioculcas is beginning to find itself brought into offices by interior landscapers, probably due to its affinity with modern design. Each of the branches coming from the compost is actually a leaf.

Stocky ZZ Plant,"
                                                        A wild new contender against the old favourite zamioculcas, this is a much stockier and denser cultivar. It grows lower to the ground with smaller spaces between the leaves, but has many of the same characteristics.
It is happiest kept in high light conditions.
