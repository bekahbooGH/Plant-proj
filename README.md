**Project Summary:**
Your Perfect Plant allows a user to peruse a large database of indoor plants.
Users can create an account to instantiate a personal greenhouse, then make additions to it. The primary function of Your Perfect Plant is that it allows a user to describe environmental conditions in their home, and returns to them a list of plants that meet those specifications.

**About the Developer:**
Your Perfect Plant was created by Bekah McCurry. Bekah was inspired by her recent hobby - actually keeping her plants alive. Some of her other interests include: baking, stalking the hummingbird that lives out her window, uncontrollably squealing over puppies, and learning to play hockey. Your Perfect Plant is Bekah's first fullstack web-application.
